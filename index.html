    <h2>Slingspot.net is the braindump of Jeremy Griffes</h2>

    <p>
        The name derives from an app I wanted to build years ago, but never quite got around to it.
        Basically it would have been similar to craigslist, but with an emphasis on mobile-centric features.

    <p>
        This site now serves as a place to jot down any notes, links, or whatever I feel comfortable sharing publicly.
        Eventually I may improve the styling and presentation, but simplicity is fine for now.
